# My Portfolio Website

This website has been made to showcase my passion for all kinds of development, and to promote my willingness to turn from a QA Developer into a Back-end Developer.

The website doesn't claim to be of any utility besides showing I'm able to do whatever I want to achieve, and for fun. :)
